    <p>My Resume: LINK</p>
    <p><em>This website is currently under construction, appologies for the limited CSS formatting</em></p>
    <h2 id="who-am-i"><strong>Who am I?</strong></h2>
    <p>I am a 23 year old recent grad from the University of Ottawa studying Computer Engineering with Engineering
        Management and Entrepreneurship and Coop Options.</p>
    <p>I am a aspiring software developer with interest in development at all levels from Firmware Embedded to Backend
        and Applications. I have had nearly 2 years COOP experience in DevOps and development roles at companies ranging
        from software defined radio to quantum computing. In my spare time I have had a variety of leadership in
        teamwork roles including organizing the first 2 occurances of uOttawa first MLH Hackathon
        <strong>uOttaHack</strong> , Chairing the Board of Ontario Engineering Student Societies <strong>ESSCO</strong>
        and serving roles in my schools and cities branches and societies of <strong>IEEE</strong> including serving
        ambassador roles at national and international events.
    </p>
    <p>My technical experinece outside my coops has focused on classwork in Android development, embedded systems (RTOS,
        Linux etc), Digital Design and Architecture (VHDL), Networking, Databases, Aritificial Intelligence and
        programming fundamentals including Python, Java, C++, Golang, Data Structures, Algorithms, Concurrecy and
        software quality (Git,CI,xUnit etc). I am predominatly a C++ , Go and Python developer but also have experience
        in Javaascript, Java and C# and am quick to pick up different development stacks.</p>
    <p>I aim to solve complex and challenging problems in the world regardless of industry but have active interest in
        <strong>Computer vision</strong>, <strong>computer graphics</strong> and <strong>media creation</strong>
        (audio\visual data manipulation, streaming, HMI for media consumption etc.) especially those who help the world
        such as MedTech and Entertainment and exploring interest in <strong>game development, Quantum Computing, VR/AR
            and web development</strong>. I want to be a lifetime learner and continue to apply myself both technically
        and creatively. In the future I also aspire to gain further skills in project management and product design to
        further create opportunities to apply my technical knowledge to new and demanding business and societal problems
    </p>
    <p>Please check out my social medias or side projects for more information on what i have done, what im working on
        and future projects!</p>

    <h2 id="what-projects-have-i-worked-on"><strong>What Projects have I worked on?</strong></h2>
    <h3 id="uottawa-roboboat"><strong>uOttawa Roboboat</strong></h3>
    <p>From 2017 to 2019, I served as a software co-lead, followed by community manager for the University of Ottawa
        Robotics team Roboboat designing a autonomous surface vehicle (i.e boat) that could compete in a variety of
        navigation tasks based on image recognition and course navigation. As co-lead for software I designed the
        architecture for the system and worked to integrate parts of the system using the ROS enviroment and Python and
        C++. I further aided in implementing XBEE radio modules to communicate between the system computer and ground
        station using Arduino interfaces and IEEE 802.15.4 communication and the algorithms for gate and cluster
        navigation of the robot using a modified A* algorithm and a designed deterministic algorithm respectively.</p>
    <h3 id="capstone-hygeing-healthcare-montior"><strong>Capstone: Hygeing Healthcare Montior</strong></h3>
    <p>For my capstone project I worked in a team of 5 designing a health managment monitor using Raspberry Pi and a
        cloud server backend that could monitor the hygeine habits of a individual using a none intrusive sensor array.
        This project was inspired by consultations with engineers from a local medical centre and were based on needs
        analysis from the &quot;Emerging Technologies to Support an Aging Population&quot; report by the US National
        Science &amp; Technology Council with the origional end goal of testing implementation in a model retirement
        home lab at a local facility. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the complete system was changed to focus on home
        hygeine and implementation techniques were made to allow further sensors for tracking washing hands and other
        general hygeine requirements. My work in this project included designing the architecture for the local device,
        development of the REST API and the communication pipeline of data collection, interpretation and distribution
        to the backend system, as well as a optional sensor for a computer vision to detect when someone was entering a
        room.</p>

    <h3 id="covid-19-charity-patch"><strong>COVID-19 Charity Patch</strong></h3>
    <p>As the pandemic began and summer work was unsure, I spent some time looking at my creative side. A student
        culture that many are unaware is the &quot;Engineering Coveralls&quot; and patch culture that is in many
        canadien engineering schools. As someone who has used this culture of trading patches as a way to network for
        the past 4 years, decided I wanted to make a patch that no only was a fun trading item but also did some good.
    </p>
    <p>Partnering with the Guelph and uOttawa Engineering Societies, I created the &quot;Don't Touch my PPE&quot; nurses
        charity patch, based on a old Guelph patch oriented around engineering safety and raised a total of $ 416.75
        alongside the nearly $500+ donations from Guelph and uOttawa that was given to local food banks, red cross and
        mental health organizations.</p>
    <h3 id="movember-2020-drive"><strong>Movember 2020 drive</strong></h3>
    <p>From the sucess of the covid charity patch, I partnered with the uOttawa Engineering Student Society to create a
        Movember 2020 campain with a charity patch based on the uOttawa EngSoc mascot &quot;Otis the bunny&quot; as well
        as collected patches from across Canada for a charity auction. Overall this event raised over $1025 for the
        Movember Foundation.</p>
